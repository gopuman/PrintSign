# PrintSign
The printing of a placard or banner can be automated by using this straightforward script.

# How it works
The script will produce distinct .html files, each containing a single letter, based on a number of inputs. When all of these files have been selected, use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> command to print them all at once.


~~ The message, font size and font color can be customized ~~
